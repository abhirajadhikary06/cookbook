# Gradle Build Optimization

This page references key external resources to help you optimize your Android Gradle builds. Below are some techniques and guides:

- [Build Caching](https://developer.android.com/build/optimize-your-build#build-cache) – Reduce unnecessary tasks by reusing outputs from previous builds.
- [Parallel Execution](https://developer.android.com/build/optimize-your-build#parallel-execution) – Execute independent tasks in parallel to speed up the build.
- [Gradle Daemon](https://developer.android.com/build/optimize-your-build#gradle-daemon) – Optimize build performance by using a persistent process for faster execution.

More original content will be added soon to cover performance monitoring, advanced caching strategies, and Gradle tuning specific to large-scale projects.
